# NLP-SpellChecker-Turkish

Developed to correct Turkish sentences written using English letters only. 
For example: if the input sentence is “beklenen olumlu tepkiyi alamadi”, the output sentence will be “beklenen olumlu tepkiyi alamadı”.
Note that “olumlu” could have been “ölümlü” but we did not choose it.
